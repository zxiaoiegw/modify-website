        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The FCCF continues to support the Filipino Association, consistent with its long-range priorities. The Foundation receives and administers funds from donors to the Filipino Cultural Center through various fundraising activities. Its primary goals are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To plan, develop, and implement a capital fund campaign for the completion, maintenance, and support of the Filipino Cultural Center.</li>
            <li>To establish a permanent exhibit area for cultural, educational, and scientific artifacts of historical and societal impact to the greater Kansas City community.</li>
            <li>To promote, maintain, and support the cultural arts, education, and community service programs.</li>
            <li>To reach out to the community at large for participation in educational, social, and health programs.</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h2>Filipino Cultural Center</h2>
        <p>The "home" of Kansas City's Filipino community, the Filipino Cultural Center (FCC) is a 5,400 SF multi-purpose facility. It is the place for dance and choir rehearsals, as well as a venue for cultural presentations, exhibits, educational workshops, and social activities. Inaugurated in 2000, the building represents the dream of many of the community's pioneers.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Since purchasing property in Overland Park, KS in 1978, the Filipino Association had been working steadfastly and patiently to build its dream - the Filipino Cultural Center - a building that would reflect its rich cultural heritage. However its fundraising efforts were slow, encumbered by the other general activities of the organization. 
          The FCCF was incorporated in 1994 with the main purpose of establishing a building fund for the Filipino Cultural Center. Over the next several years, the Foundation conducted a dedicated capital fund campaign. In 2000 Phase I of the Filipino Cultural Center was successfully completed.</p>
